**Project Title**
Understanding our patients

**Description**
Used real life anonymised data on patients belonging to a population medicine program. The purpose of this project was to clean the data and then test a number of business based hypotheses. 
I chose to (a) verify the number of patients in the program, and (b) to determine their risk profile. Part (b) involved correlation analysis, as there was only pure risk data for a sub-section of the population.
